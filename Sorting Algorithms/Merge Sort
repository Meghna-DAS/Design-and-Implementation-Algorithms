Advantages of merge sort

It is quicker for larger lists because unlike insertion and bubble sort it doesnt go through the whole list seveal times. 
It has a consistent running time, carries out different bits with similar  times in a stage. 

Disadvantages of merge sort

Slower comparative to the other sort algorithms for smaller tasks. 
goes through the whole process even i he list is sorted (just like insertion and bubble sort?) 
uses more memory space to store the sub elements of the initial split list. 

Time Complexity of merge sort

Best Case Complexity: O(n*log n) 
Worst Case Complexity: O(n*log n) 
Average Case Complexity: O(n*log n) 

 
Space Complexity of merge sort
The space complexity of merge sort is O(n).
